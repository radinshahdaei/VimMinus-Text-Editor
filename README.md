# VimMinus Text Editor

This repository contains the project for the Fundumentals of Programming course in the Fall 2022 semster. It is a replication of the classic Vim editor found in all shells using C for all programming purposes and NCurses as the GUI library. For usage, simply compile and run the `phase[1,2].c` files.
